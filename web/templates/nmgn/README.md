## Select Template

The default template loaded is the "CanCOGeN Covid-19" template. To change the spreadsheet template, select the white text box to the right of **Template**, it always contains the name of the template currently active, or navigated to **File** followed by **Change Template**. An in-app window will appear that allows you to select from the available templates in the drop-down menu. After selecting the desired template, click **Open** to activate the template.

A second way to access templates directly, rather than by the hard-coded menu system, is to specify the DataHarmonizer template subfolder via a "template" URL parameter. This enables development and use of customized templates, or new ones, that DH doesn't have programmed in menu.
